# The maximum number of molecules per job is restricted by two factors:
# 1) The variable max_num_molecules_per_job below, and
# 2) The module-specific limit, which is defined by the number of molecules it can process in
#    the time given by max_job_duration_minutes below.
# The actual limit is the minimum of these two values.
